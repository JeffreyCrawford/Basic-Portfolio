            Welcome to my personal homepage! My name is Jeff Crawford, and I'm currently employed as an IT contractor
            for NOPEC, a non-profit council of governments focused on reducing energy bills for local residents and 
            communities. I conduct data analysis on membership and savings, and administrate the technological and 
            reporting aspects of many of NOPEC's programs to facilitate their expansion throughout the state of Ohio.
            I have BAs in Political Science and Psychology from Case Western Reserve University with a concentration 
            on American political outreach and mobilization campaigns. I have additional history in IT helpdesk 
            support and several cycles of election experience. I am currently in a training program to be a full-stack
            web developer. I am seeking to leverage these skills to create custom web-based IT solutions
            for commercial and political use.
